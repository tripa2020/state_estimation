This project contains the algorithms for localization and object tracking utilizing using a particle filter. This was project ulitizes ros the robotic stack, and rviz for the simulation visualization. 

Applciation: the real world application include recieving visual data from an overhead camera on a simulated robotic arm and car.

This is the image of the sucessfull particle filter object detection for the robotic arm

And the corresponding error in position error plot
